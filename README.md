# Python-for-Joystick
This project enables PS4 joystick interaction via Python. The script reads joystick inputs using the pygame library and transmits data wirelessly to an Arduino board via Bluetooth. The Arduino interprets this data to control hardware. Ideal for DIY projects requiring joystick-based control mechanisms.
